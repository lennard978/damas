            <strong>American/European Roulette </strong> is a casino
            game named after the French word meaning
            <strong>little wheel</strong>. In the game, players may
            choose to place bets on either a single number or a
            range of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether
            the number is odd or even.<br />
            As with many games, there are competing theories as to
            the origin of Roulette. The most popular is that it was
            invented in 1655 by a French scientist called Blaise
            Pascal during his monastic retreat and first played in a
            casino in Paris.
            <br />The second is very similar and simply says that it
            was invented by a random French monk to alleviate the
            monotony of simple monastery life. <br />The third
            theory is that French Dominican monks invented Roulette,
            basing it upon an old Tibetan game in which the object
            was to arrange 37 animal statuettes into a magic number
            square of 666 <br />In the 19th century, roulette spread
            all over Europe and the US, becoming one of the most
            famous and most popular casino games.

            Over the years the origin of <strong>Blackjack</strong>,
            like many other games, has eluded researchers for a long
            time and which continues to be hotly debated to this
            day. Till date there has been no clear consensus, but
            most agree it probably originated in French casinos
            around 1700, where it was called Vingt-et-Un which,
            translated, means twenty-one.<br />
            It gradually spread to North America thanks to French
            colonists and soon after it was played throughout the
            continent.
            <br />
            <br />
            To draw more people to the game, some casinos then
            offered a special bet: A hand featuring either of the
            black jacks (the Jack of Spades or that of Clubs) plus
            the Ace of Spades would pay 10-to-1 odds on the lucky
            player’s bet. Although casinos later discontinued this
            peculiar payout, the name ‘blackjack’ or ‘black jack’
            remained, as the game is known today.

            <strong>Poker</strong> is the world’s most popular card
            game – and its’ one with a rich history that began well
            before the early 19th century, when poker as we know it
            today came into being.<br />

            This game was invented sometime prior to 969 CE, when
            Emperor Mu-Tsung and his wife celebrated New Year’s Eve
            with a festive, rousing game of chance that blended
            elements of poker and mahjong. 12th and 13th century
            Egyptians enjoying games played with cards, and 16th
            century Persians inventing Ganjifa, also known as
            Treasure Cards
            <br /><br />Like poker, the historic Persain game of As
            Nas was extremely popular.About the same time, a Spanish
            game called “Primero” became popular <br />Germans soon
            began playing a game called “Pochen,” and the French
            started to play a game called “Poque;” these sprang from
            Primero, which is often referred to as the mother of
            modern poker.When French colonials came to Canada, they
            brought their beloved game with them; it was the
            national card game of France, and it soon became popular
            throughout the new world, eventually traveling from New
            Orleans, up the Mississippi River and throughout what
            would eventually become the United States, where modern
            poker was developed. <br />Soldiers, cowboys, and
            gentlemen of every stripe enjoyed poker throughout the
            19th century; both Union and Confederate troops enjoyed
            the game during the Civil War, and it was so popular
            across the West that just about every town boasted
            saloons with poker tables. Unlike other games that have
            faded into the annals of history, poker continues to
            gain popularity with in-person and online players
            worldwide.

            <strong>From Hazard to Crabs to Craps</strong
            ><br />People have been playing dice games for a very
            long time. The very first dice were just sheep
            knucklebones. There is some evidence that suggests that
            the game of craps may have evolved during the Holy Roman
            Empire. In those times, soldiers in the Roman legions
            used to shave down pig knuckles into the shapes of
            cubes. They used to then play with them by tossing them
            onto their inverted shields as a game while in camp. It
            is here that the term "to roll the bones" got prevalent.
            After becoming prevalent in Europe the game gained
            popularity in United States also. <br />Another theory
            states that the game of craps is much similar to a game
            called <strong>azzahr</strong> or
            <strong>Hazard</strong> that was played during the
            Middle Ages by the Arabs. The formal rules for Hazard
            were established by Montmort early in the 1700s.
            <br />Some also feel that the French, trying to be
            amiable, adopted the term from the English, but spelt it
            in the French way as crabs. <br />In approximately
            around the year 1755, the French lost Acadia and the
            Acadians relocated to Louisiana. Here they dropped the
            French crabes and called the game crebs or creps. By
            1843, American English caused the term craps to gain
            prevalence. <br />The most commonly accepted version of
            the history of craps claims that this dice-based game of
            chance was a descendant of an early-English game called
            hazard. Hazard was a game invented by an English noble
            Sir William of Tyre and his knights during the Crusades.
