            <h3>American/European Roulette</h3>
            <img src="images/games/3.jpg" />
            <p>
              <strong>Roulette</strong> is a casino game named after the French
              word meaning <strong>little wheel</strong>.

              <p>
                In the game,players may choose to place bets on either a single
                numbers or a range of numbers, the colors red or black, or
                whether the number is odd or even.
              </p>
              <p>
                As with many games, there are competing theories as to the
                origin of Roulette. The most popular is that it was invented in
                1655 by a French scientist called Blaise Pascal during his
                monastic retreat and first played in a casino in Paris. The
                second is very similar and simply says that it was invented by a
                random French monk to alleviate the monotony of simple monastery
                life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The third theory is that French Dominican monks invented
                Roulette, basing it upon an old Tibetan game in which the object
                was to arrange 37 animal statuettes into a magic number square
                of 666 In the 19th century, roulette spread all over Europe and
                the US, becoming one of the most famous and most popular casino
                games.

                Over the years the origin of <strong>Blackjack</strong>, like
                many other games, has eluded researchers for a long time and
                which continues to be hotly debated to this day. Till date there
                has been no clear consensus, but most agree it probably
                originated in French casinos around 1700, where it was called
                Vingt-et-Un which, translated, means twenty-one. It gradually
                spread to North America thanks to French colonists and soon
                after it was played throughout the continent.

                To draw more people to the game, some casinos then offered a
                special bet: A hand featuring either of the black jacks (the
                Jack of Spades or that of Clubs) plus the Ace of Spades would
                pay 10-to-1 odds on the lucky player’s bet. Although casinos
                later discontinued this peculiar payout, the name ‘blackjack’ or
                ‘black jack’ remained, as the game is known today.

              <p><strong>From Hazard to Crabs to Craps</strong><br /></p>
              <p>
                People have been playing dice games for a very long time. The
                very first dice were just sheep knucklebones. There is some
                evidence that suggests that the game of craps may have evolved
                during the Holy Roman Empire. In those times, soldiers in the
                Roman legions used to shave down pig knuckles into the shapes of
                cubes. They used to then play with them by tossing them onto
                their inverted shields as a game while in camp. It is here that
                the term "to roll the bones" got prevalent. After becoming
                prevalent in Europe the game gained popularity in United States
                also. Another theory states that the game of craps is much
                similar to a game called <strong>azzahr</strong> or
                <strong>Hazard</strong> that was played during the Middle Ages
                by the Arabs. The formal rules for Hazard were established by
                Montmort early in the 1700s. Some also feel that the French,
                trying to be amiable, adopted the term from the English, but
                spelt it in the French way as crabs.In approximately around the
                year 1755, the French lost Acadia and the Acadians relocated to
                Louisiana. Here they dropped the French crabes and called the
                game crebs or creps. By 1843, American English caused the term
                craps to gain prevalence.The most commonly accepted version of
                the history of craps claims that this dice-based game of chance
                was a descendant of an early-English game called hazard. Hazard
                was a game invented by an English noble Sir William of Tyre and
                his knights during the Crusades.

                <strong>Poker</strong> is the world’s most popular card game –
                and its’ one with a rich history that began well before the
                early 19th century, when poker as we know it today came into
                being. This game was invented sometime prior to 969 CE, when
                Emperor Mu-Tsung and his wife celebrated New Year’s Eve with a
                festive, rousing game of chance that blended elements of poker
                and mahjong. 12th and 13th century Egyptians enjoying games
                played with cards, and 16th century Persians inventing Ganjifa,
                also known as Treasure Cards Like poker, the historic Persain
                game of As Nas was extremely popular.About the same time, a
                Spanish game called “Primero” became popular Germans soon began
                playing a game called “Pochen,” and the French started to play a
                game called “Poque;” these sprang from Primero, which is often
                referred to as the mother of modern poker.When French colonials
                came to Canada, they brought their beloved game with them; it
                was the national card game of France, and it soon became popular
                throughout the new world, eventually traveling from New Orleans,
                up the Mississippi River and throughout what would eventually
                become the United States, where modern poker was
                developed.Soldiers, cowboys, and gentlemen of every stripe
                enjoyed poker throughout the 19th century; both Union and
                Confederate troops enjoyed the game during the Civil War, and it
                was so popular across the West that just about every town
                boasted saloons with poker tables. Unlike other games that have
                faded into the annals of history, poker continues to gain
                popularity with in-person and online players worldwide.
